# odds-and-ends
Some of the projects I'm currently working on, testing or just fiddling with. 

NOTE:

I'm defintely not an expert here, so please check the code before you use it elsewhere. I'm using this repo mostly as a testing ground of some of the things in my head, as well as helping me become a better engineer. I'm also available for questions if there are any!
